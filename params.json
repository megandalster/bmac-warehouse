{"name":"Bmac-warehouse","tagline":"A food warehouse inventory and distribution assistant","body":"Critical to the operation of The Blue Mountain Action Council (BMAC) is its food distribution warehouse, located in Walla Walla, WA.  Food obtained from a variety of sources is stored there until it can be delivered to Walla Walla’s emergency food pantries.\r\n\r\nA Microsoft Access ­based inventory system had been­ designed several years ago to support the record ­keeping and reporting needs of the warehouse.  it was out of date.  \r\n\r\nTo modernize this process, a 2015 student team from nearby Whitman College developed software that enables warehouse staff to manage product inventory, issue receipts for donations, and generate invoices for shipments to local food distribution centers.  This software enables the warehouse to more accurately and efficiently manage its food inventory database and reporting capabilities. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the BMAC-Warehouse code base, the design document, sandbox database, and weekly assignments from the Spring 2015 class can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B89idqv1KuSVVVVId0k0YURkc3M&usp=sharing).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
