				  	<a href="tutorial/screenshots/searchDonorStep1.png" class="centered" title="searchDonorStep1.png" style="width:500px; display:block;">
					 	<img src="tutorial/screenshots/searchDonorStep1.png" style="display:block; width:500px; border-width:1px; border-style:solid">
					</a>
				<p><b>Step 2:</b> You can now enter a name in the name field and/or a city in the city field. You can also leave both 
					search fields blank, and the search function will return all of the donors in the database. After typing your criterion in the 
					appropriate fields, select the <b>Search</b> button, and the form will return matching results like this:

						<img src="tutorial/screenshots/searchDonorStep2.png" style="display:block; width:500px; border-width:1px; border-style:solid">
					</a>
				<p>If this list has the donor you want to view or edit, then simply click on the donor and the edit existing donor information form
				  will appear. Click <a href="http://localhost/mch-homeplatecivi/help.php?helpPage=donorEdit.php">here</a> for more details
				  on how to do that. If you don't see what you were looking for, you can try again. The search box is always present at the top of the page.</p>
				<p><b>Step 3:</b> When you finish, you can return to any other function by selecting it on the navigation bar.</p>
